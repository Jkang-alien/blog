	abstract = {Breast cancers with PIK3CA mutations can be treated with PIK3CA inhibitors in hormone receptor-positive HER2 negative subtypes. We applied a supervised elastic net penalized logistic regression model to predict PIK3CA mutations from gene expression data. This regression approach was applied to predict modeling using the TCGA pan-cancer dataset. Approximately 10,000 cases were available for PIK3CA mutation and mRNA expression data. In 10-fold cross-validation, the model with λ = 0.01 and α = 1.0 (ridge regression) showed the best performance, in terms of area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC). The final model was developed with selected hyper-parameters using the entire training set. The training set AUROC was 0.93, and the test set AUROC was 0.84. The area under the precision-recall (AUPR) of the training set was 0.66, and the test set AUPR was 0.39. Cancer types were the most important predictors. Both insulin like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R) and the phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) were the most significant genes in gene expression predictors. Our study suggests that predicting genomic alterations using gene expression data is possible, with good outcomes.},

	abstract = {Background Spread through air spaces (STAS) has recently been demonstrated to exhibit a negative impact on lung adenocarcinoma prognosis. However, most of these studies investigated STAS in nonmucinous adenocarcinoma. Here, we investigated the incidence of STAS in invasive mucinous adenocarcinoma (IMA) of the lung and evaluated whether tumor STAS was a risk factor of disease recurrence in IMA. We also examined clinicoradiologic factors in patients with IMA harboring STAS. Methods We reviewed pathologic specimens and imaging characteristics of primary tumors from 132 consecutive patients who underwent surgical resection for IMA to evaluate STAS. Patients with and without STAS were compared with respect to clinical characteristics as well as computed tomography (CT) imaging using logistic regression. The relationships between all variables including STAS and survival were analyzed. Results Among a total of 132 patients, full pathologic specimens were available for 119 patients, and STAS was observed in 86 (72.3\%). IMA patients with STAS were significantly associated with older age, presence of lobulated and spiculated margins on CT scan (P = 0.009, P = 0.006, and P = 0.027). In multivariate analysis for overall survival (OS), STAS was a borderline independent poor prognostic predictor (P = 0.028). Older age, history of smoking, higher T stage, presence of lymph node metastasis, and consolidative morphologic type remained independent predictors for OS. Conclusions STAS was associated with reduced OS and was a borderline independent poor prognostic factor in IMA. IMA with STAS was associated with older age and presence of lobulated and spiculated margins on CT scan. Key points Significant findings of the study Compared with other subtypes, IMA shows a higher incidence of STAS, which is an independent poor prognostic predictor even in IMA. Lobulated and spiculated margins on CT are associated with STAS. What this study adds Considering that STAS can carry the potential for aerogenous metastasis, predicting STAS using preoperative surrogate CT imaging is desirable to avoid limited resection.},

	abstract = {Introduction
The detection of BRCA1/2 mutations is important because PARP1 inhibitors are approved for germline and/or somatic BRCA-mutated advanced ovarian cancer. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) is increasingly used in clinical practice for BRCA1/2 mutations. The purpose of this study was to consider several conditions of NGS BRCA1/2 assay applicable to clinical laboratory tests, in particular for using formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) ovarian tissues.
Materials and methods
We selected 64 ovarian cancer patients and performed Oncomine™ BRCA assay using FFPE tissue. Effect of FFPE sample quality was analyzed by NGS quality parameters including deamination metric. Somatic variants were selected by removing germline variants of peripheral blood and interpreted as pathogenic, variants of unknown significance, and false positive.
Results
We found a positive relationship between the number of variants over the deamination metric and FFPE age (P {\textless} 0.001) with a cutoff values of approximately 0.7 and 60 months, respectively. When comparing NGS results with Sanger sequencing, NGS misreported 3 of 15 variants using default parameters which were corrected after changing parameters. We detected somatic variants in eight patients and classified them into pathogenic (n = 3), VUS (n = 3) and false positive (n = 2).
Conclusions
This study is important for improving BRCA1/2 mutation detection capabilities of NGS analytical pipelines and strategy to overcome their limitations using FFPE tissue in ovarian cancer patients.},

Here we present a case in which a lung tumor, which resembled an atypical carcinoid tumor, was revealed as metastatic breast cancer by next generation sequencing. A 50-year-old female, who had received modified radical mastectomy for breast cancer, presented with a 2.1 cm sized lung mass. The mass was well-defined, well-enhanced, and showed endobronchial component by computed tomography. Under the impression of carcinoid tumor, right upper lobectomy was performed. Tumor cells were immunohistochemically positive for chromogranin and CD56, but negative for cytokeratin 7 and GCDFP-15. Initially, the patient was diagnosed with atypical carcinoid tumor. However, subsequent NGS test revealed GATA3 mutation (p.Ala333fs) of the lung tumor. After a thorough review of literature and public cancer genome data about GATA3 mutation, the diagnosis was revised to metastatic invasive carcinoma from breast.},

	abstract = {Growing evidence suggests that the efficacy of immunotherapy in non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) is associated with the immune microenvironment within the tumor. We aimed to explore radiologic phenotyping using a radiomics approach to assess the immune microenvironment in NSCLC. Two independent NSCLC cohorts (training and test sets) were included. Single-sample gene set enrichment analysis was used to determine the tumor microenvironment, where type 1 helper T (Th1) cells, type 2 helper T (Th2) cells, and cytotoxic T cells were the targets for prediction with computed tomographic (CT) radiomic features. Multiple algorithms were in the modeling followed by final model selection. The training dataset comprised 89 NSCLCs and the test set included 60 cases of lung squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma. A total of 239 CT radiomic features were used. A linear discriminant analysis model was selected for the final model of Th2 cell group prediction. The area under the curve value of the final model on the test set was 0.684. Predictors of the linear discriminant analysis model were skewness (total and outer pixels), kurtosis, variance (subsampled from delta [subtraction inner pixels from outer pixels]), and informational measure of correlation. The performances of radiomics on test set of Th1 and cytotoxic T cell were not accurate enough to be predictable. A radiomics approach can be used to interrogate an entire tumor in a noninvasive manner and provide added diagnostic value to identify the immune microenvironment of NSCLC, in particular, Th2 cell signatures.},
