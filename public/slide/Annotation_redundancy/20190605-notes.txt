The most common activating ERBB2 indel in lung cancer results from duplication of 12 nucleotides in exon 20, resulting in insertion of four amino acids in the protein sequence, but can be annotated in multiple ways The reference genomic nucleotide sequence and resulting amino acid sequence at the beginning of exon 20, with amino acid numbering according the the NP_00439 isoform of the ERBB2/HER2 protein, are shown (a) Three possible annotations for the activating ERBB2 indel are shown ( b,c , and d; inserted nucleotides and amino acids shown in red, reference shown in blue) In (b and c), the inserted nucleotide sequence is the same (GCATACGTGATG), but the site of insertion is different In (b), the insertion is made at the beginning of the reference AYVM sequence, with the genomic annotation chr17:9.37880982ins12 and protein annotation NP_004439:p3770_A771insAYVM. In 使, the insertion is made after the reference AYVM sequence, shifting the indel annotations to chr17:g.37880994ins12 and NP_004439:pM774_A775insAYVM However, the resulting nucleotide and amino acid sequences are exactly the same in (b) and 使 However, the same insertion also can be annotated with what seems to be a completely different inserted sequence (d). Note that the amino acid before and after the reference YVM is an alanine. However, the reference A771 is encoded by the genomic sequence GCA, whereas the reference A775 is encoded by the genomic sequence GCT. Insertion of the sequence ATACGTGATGGC, splitting the GC and T that normally encode A775(i.e., genomic annotation chr17:g.37880995_37880996insATACGTGATGGC) keeps an A at amino acid number 775 (though now encoded by GCA instead of the reference GCT)
