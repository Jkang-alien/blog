  abstract = {Somatic mutations of ERBB2 and ERBB3 (which encode HER2 and HER3, respectively) are found in a wide range of cancers. Preclinical modelling suggests that a subset of these mutations lead to constitutive HER2 activation, but most remain biologically uncharacterized. Here we define the biological and therapeutic importance of known oncogenic HER2 and HER3 mutations and variants of unknown biological importance by conducting a multi-histology, genomically selected, 'basket' trial using the pan-HER kinase inhibitor neratinib (SUMMIT; clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT01953926). Efficacy in HER2-mutant cancers varied as a function of both tumour type and mutant allele to a degree not predicted by preclinical models, with the greatest activity seen in breast, cervical and biliary cancers and with tumours that contain kinase domain missense mutations. This study demonstrates how a molecularly driven clinical trial can be used to refine our biological understanding of both characterized and new genomic alterations with potential broad applicability for advancing the paradigm of genome-driven oncology.},

  abstract = {Purpose: Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) genotyping is now standard in the management of advanced lung adenocarcinoma, as this biomarker predicts marked beneﬁt from treatment with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI). EGFR exon 19 insertions are a poorly described family of EGFR mutations, and their association with EGFR-TKI sensitivity in lung adenocarcinoma is uncertain. Experimental Design: Patients with lung cancers harboring EGFR exon 19 insertions were studied. The predicted effects of the insertions on the structure of the EGFR protein were examined, and EGFR exon 19 insertions were introduced into Ba/F3 cells to assess oncogenicity and in vitro sensitivity to EGFR-TKIs. In patients receiving TKI, response magnitude was assessed with serial computed tomographic (CT) measurement.
Results: Twelve tumors harboring EGFR exon 19 insertions were identiﬁed; patients were predominately female (92\%) and never-smokers (75\%). The 11 specimens available for full sequencing all showed an 18bp insertion that resulted in the substitution of a Pro for Leu at residue 747. The mutant EGFR transformed the Ba/F3 cells, which were then sensitive to EGFR-TKI. Six patients with measurable disease received TKI and ﬁve had a response on serial CT.
Conclusions: EGFR exon 19 insertions are a newly appreciated family of EGFR-TKI–sensitizing mutations, and patients with tumors harboring these mutations should be treated with EGFR-TKI. While these mutations may be missed through the use of some mutation-speciﬁc assays, the addition of PCR product size analysis to multigene assays allows sensitive detection of both exon 19 insertion and deletion mutations.
