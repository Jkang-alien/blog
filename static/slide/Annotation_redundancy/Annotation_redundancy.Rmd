# Mutation Nomenclature [-@dunnen_2000_mutation_hummutat] 

> No recommendations have been made to describe
duplications. Although they can be seen as a specific
type of insertion, and could be described as such,
they often originate through other mutational mechanisms.
We therefore prefer to provide a distinctive
designation of this type of sequence change
