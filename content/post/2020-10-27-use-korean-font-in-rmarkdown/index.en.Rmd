### yaml
```
---
mainfont: NanumGothic
output:
  pdf_document: 
    latex_engine: xelatex
---
```

The mainfont is the LaTex option. The argument is a font family. The **exact names** of the font family can be found in the fonts folder. Expand the header of the fonts folder. **NanumGothic** is the exact name of the font family. 

The font family should be **Editable embedding** type (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/opentype/spec/os2#fstype).

The LaTex engine should be xelatex.

Let's use another Korean font on pdf generated by rmarkdown.  

You can use Roboto google font with  

```
header-includes:
    - \usepackage[sfdefault]{roboto}
    - \usepackage[T1]{fontenc}
output: 
  pdf_document: 
    latex_engine: pdflatex
mainfont: roboto
```
