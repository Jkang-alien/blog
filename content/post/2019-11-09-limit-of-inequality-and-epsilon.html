<p>Here I summarize some tools for proof of the Riesz representation theorem. They are the limit of inequality of sequence and <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon\)</span>. The Rudin’s proof of the Riesz representation theorem construct measure <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> and measurable set <span class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{M}\)</span>, then prove the <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{M}\)</span> have properties. Countable additivity (not subadditivity) is an important property. The strategy of proving equality (additivity) is bidirectional inequality.</p>
<p>Limit of inequality of sequence gives us a tool that finite inequality makes infinite inequality. <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon\)</span> changes left and right parts of inequality (bidirectional inequality).</p>
<p>If <span class="math inline">\(\Sigma^n_1\mu(K) \le \Sigma^n_1\mu(V_i)\)</span> then <span class="math inline">\(\Sigma^{\infty}_1 \mu(K) \le \Sigma^{\infty}_1 \mu(V)\)</span>, K is compact and V is open. We can change both sides of inequality with <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon\)</span>. <span class="math inline">\(\Sigma^{\infty}_1 \mu(V) \le \Sigma^{\infty}_1 \mu(K) + \epsilon\)</span>.</p>
<p>Urison’s lemma is used for <span class="math inline">\(\mu(E) = \inf\mu(V) = \sup\mu(K)\)</span> if $ E  $ and $ K E V$.</p>
