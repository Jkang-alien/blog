\[ f(x) = \sum_{k=0}^\infty c_k x^k = c_0 + c_1 x + c_2 x^2 + \dotsb. \] 


This is an approximation that is a function of h and derivatives of $f(x)$ are elements of parameters.  

$f(x \pm h) = f(x) \pm hf'(x) + \frac{h^2}{2}f''(x) \pm \frac{h^3}{6}f'''(x) + O(h^4)$

Let's think about $\sin(x)$.  


$$ f(x) = \sin(x) \ f(0) = 0, f'(x)=\cos(x)\ f'(0)=1, f''(x)=-\sin(x)\ f''(0)=0 $$

Thus,

\begin{align*} \sin(x) &= 0 + \frac{1}{1!}x + \frac{0}{2!}x^2 + \frac{-1}{3!}x^3 + \dotsb
&= x - \frac{x^3}{3!} + \frac{x^5}{5!} - \dotsb, \end{align*}


This is approximation. Now $x$ becomes $h$ and parameters calculated from derivatives of $f(x)$ at $0$.  
$f(x \pm h) = f(x) \pm hf'(x) + \frac{h^2}{2}f''(x) \pm \frac{h^3}{6}f'''(x) + O(h^4)$

Taylor series and Newton's bionomial theorem explain the complex exponent. 

$$\exp(z) = e^{z}, \ z = a+bi $$

The imaginary exponent is hard to understand intuitively. The exponential function $e^{x}$ on a complex domain can be regarded as a function exp(x) that behaves like exponential function, i.e. a product of functions is addion of arguments $\exp(x) \exp(y) = \exp(x+y)$. The product of $\exp$ fucntion becomes addition of arguments by Newton's binomical theorem. The costomary expression is $e^{x}$. This can be done when $\exp(x) = \Sigma ^{\infty}_{n=0} \frac {Z^{n}}{n!}$ The taylor series with repidly decaying pactorial coefficients $n!$. This series converges absolutely for every complex $z$ and converges uniformly on every bounded subset of the complex plain. Rudin's Real and complex analysis.
