<p>Differential equation solution is infinite function series. The infinite function series can be a sort of linear combination of countable function vector, in terms of linear algebra. This raises the problem of the analysis of function. The problem includes a distance of two functions, ie norm, completeness (Banach space). Because the series adds the last term without changing the existing terms, orthogonality is required to make a linear combination of countable functional vector becomes infinite function series (Hilbert space).</p>
<p>To make a space of continous function on a compact interval <span class="math inline">\(C(I)\)</span> be complete (Banach space), take the maximum norm. To make a space of <span class="math inline">\(C(I)\)</span> orthogonal, take the norm associated with inner product <span class="math inline">\(\| f \| := \sqrt{ \langle f,f \rangle}\)</span>. The inner product is a map of symmetric sesquilinear form (Hermitian form). In <span class="math inline">\(C(I)\)</span>, the inner product is <span class="math display">\[ \langle f,g \rangle := \int_{a}^{b} f^{*} (x)g(x)dx \]</span>
But the <span class="math inline">\(C(I)\)</span> with the norm associated with an inner product is not complete. The complete can be achieved by extension to the Lebesgue integrable function. The right norm and the right functional set have special properties like complete and orthogonality.</p>
