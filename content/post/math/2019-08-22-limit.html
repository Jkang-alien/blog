<p>A sequence can be defined as a function on the domain of natural number like <span class="math inline">\(1, 1/2, 1/3 ... 1/n\)</span>. This sequence approach to the 0, but never touch the 0. However, people can not take their desire to link the sequence and the 0. Because <span class="math inline">\(\infty\)</span> is not a member of the natural number even real number, another concept is necessary to link the sequence and the 0. It is the limit. <span class="math display">\[ \lim{n\to\infty} \]</span></p>
<p>The above sequence approach to the 0. But does all sequences approach to some points? What if the sequence is <span class="math inline">\(1/n\)</span> if <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is not multiple of 100, 0.001 if n is multiple of 100.</p>

<p>Its approach to zero except at every multiple of 10. The <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon\)</span> is used for the definition of limit to exclude this example.</p>
<p>The sequence <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> is converges the limit <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> if for every positive <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon\)</span>, natural number <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> is present such that <span class="math inline">\(\vert a-Sn \vert &lt;\epsilon\)</span> is true in every <span class="math inline">\(n&gt;N\)</span>. Otherwise, the limit is not defined and the sequence is divergent.</p>
<p>In topological space, the <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon\)</span> becomes the neighborhood.</p>
