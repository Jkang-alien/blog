<p>The reproducing kernel hilbert space (RKHS) was my motivation to study analysis. The hilbert space is a orthogonal normed vector space. I still do not know about the meaning of “reproducing kernal”. The RKHS appeared in the book titled <em>An Introduction to Statisitical Learning</em> written by Hastie.</p>
<p>I began to google the meaning of the spaces such as the Hilbert, Banarch. I decided to read the <em>Understaing Analysis</em> written by Abbott. The <em>Understaing Analysis</em> was give me many intuitions of analysis and encouraged me to study further. The next book was Rudin’s <em>Functional Analysis</em>. I realized I need to go upstream to complex Analysis, topology and measure.</p>
<p>During the journey of exploring the analysis, I skipped proving of theorems or solving exercises. But space between lines is coming. I’m realizing that I prove the spaces. <span class="math display">\[\Sigma^{k}_{j=1} {\lvert}a_j-a^{n}_j{\rvert}\le\epsilon \]</span> This holds for all finite <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>, we even have <span class="math inline">\({\lVert} a-a_n {\rVert} _{1}\le\epsilon\)</span>. This is on the way of the proof of <span class="math inline">\(l^{1}(\mathbb{N})\)</span> of all complex-valued sequences <span class="math inline">\(a=(a_j)^{\infty}_{j=1}\)</span> for which the norm <span class="math inline">\({\lVert} a {\rVert} _{1}\ := \Sigma^{\infty}_{j=1} {\lvert}a_j{\rvert}\)</span>.</p>
<p>I could not just accept that the finite sum of each small differences <span class="math inline">\(\le \epsilon\)</span> of <span class="math inline">\({\lvert}a_j - a^n_j{\rvert}\)</span> holds to the infinite sum. The infinite sum is a infinte series. If the infinite series is less than or equel to zero, then it converses to the zero. If the finite sum is <span class="math inline">\(\le \epsilon\)</span> holds every <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{N}\)</span>, by definition the infinite sum is also <span class="math inline">\(\le \epsilon\)</span>.</p>
<p>It takes long time to grasp the subtle mathmatical systems. For example, a series is a number in a scalar field, a sequence is a ordered set. However the long time makes the math become familar and finally will firmly grasp the subtle concepts.</p>
