<p>The compact is a property of space. In a nutshell, if space is compact, we can treat the space be a <strong>finite</strong> because space has a <strong>finite subcover</strong>. A continuous function on a compact space is uniformly continuous.</p>
<p>Heine-Borel theorem describes the condition of compactness of <strong>finite</strong> dimensional space. <strong>Closed and bounded</strong> But the Heine-Borel theorem does not hold in an <strong>infinite-dimensional</strong> space. We need another condition.</p>
<p>Previously, the compact space can be finite by taking subcover. The infinite-dimensional space can be finite by projection to finite dimension. If we could make as small as possible (i.e. <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon &gt; 0\)</span> ) the norm of <span class="math inline">\((X\backslash(1-P)\)</span>, the compactness is achieved.</p>
