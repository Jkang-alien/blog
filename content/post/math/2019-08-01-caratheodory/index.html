<p>The studying sometimes starts with learning of boring preceding concepts. The highlight comes later. In history, the highlight concepts or the important problem were centered and the supporting concepts or lemmas followed. One of the central ideas of analysis is <strong>extension</strong>. The set of a rational number (<span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{Q}\)</span>) extends to the real line <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}\)</span>. The Jordan measurable sets extend to the Lebesgue measurable sets ( <span class="math inline">\(\sigma -algebra\)</span> ).</p>
<p>The outer measure can measure <strong>all</strong> subsets of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>, whereas measure can only measure a <span class="math inline">\(\sigma -algebra\)</span> of measure set. The Carathéodory measurability defines the condition to make a <span class="math inline">\(\sigma -algebra\)</span>.<br />
<span class="math display">\[ \mu^*(A) = \mu^*(A \cap E) + \mu^*(A \cap E^c) \]</span>
The Carathéodory extension theorem defines a condition to make an outer measure to a measure. The condition is that the outer measure applies to the Carathéodory measurable set (<span class="math inline">\(\sigma - algebra\)</span>). (Torrence Tao, An introduction to measure theory)</p>
<p>In the Riesz representation therorem, <span class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{M}_F\)</span> extends to <span class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{M}\)</span>. The outer measure is <span class="math inline">\(\mu(E) = sup\ \ \{\mu(K): K \subset E,\ \ K \ \ compact \}\)</span> for every <span class="math inline">\(E \subset X\)</span> analogus to Jordan outer measure. <span class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{M}_F\)</span> is collection of subset <span class="math inline">\(E \subset X\)</span> satisfying <span class="math inline">\(\mu (E) &lt; \infty\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\mu (V) = sup \{\Lambda f:f\prec V \}\)</span> analogus to Jordan inner measure. Thus <span class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{M}_F\)</span> is analous to Jordan measurable set. <span class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{M}\)</span> is collection of subset <span class="math inline">\(E \subset X\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(E \cap K \ \in \ \ \mathfrak{M}_F\)</span> for every compact <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span>. This is the Carathéodory measurability. So the <span class="math inline">\(\mu(E)\)</span> on the <span class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{M}\)</span> becomes measure.
