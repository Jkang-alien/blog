## First day

### Lobular carcinoma
- Christos Sotitiou, Institue Jules Bordet
- ILC tumor microenvironment & PI3K inhibition (taselisib)
  - ILC appears enriched in M2 macrophages with increased PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling without pathway alterations.
- Higher M2/M1 ratio is associated with better **taselisib** response, **independent of PIK3CA mutation status**.
- Lobular tumors show higher ORR with taselisib than placebo in both **PIK3CA-mut** and **PIK3CA-wt** subsets.
- A proposed dual mechanism: inhibition of **PI3Kα** in tumor cells and **PI3Kγ** in macrophages, potentially driving macrophage repolarization and stronger anti-tumor immunity.
- ILC4TME framework suggests four ILC subtypes (NSE, P, ARE, MIE) that may enable refined patient stratification.

- Clinical context 
- **RX-PONDER**: chemo benefit appears smallest around higher RS and increases as RS decreases, with greatest benefit at very low RS.
- **Genomic risk**: ILC and IDC show **nearly identical outcomes** when matched by genomic risk categories.

### Implications for next ILC-specific trials
- Prioritize mechanism-based treatment selection and resistance planning.
- Use ILC-suitable assessments (e.g., WB-MRI, FES-PET, FAPI-PET, liquid biopsies).
- Consider ILC-suitable endpoints (cellularity, ctDNA dynamics, long-term outcomes).
- Ensure central pathology review; incorporate surgical endpoints.
- Build multi-center/international recruitment networks.

## Second day

- HER2Climb-05
  - Tucatinib + HP for maintainance for her2+ metastatic breast cancer
  - Tucatinib may be another option especially brain metastasis
  
- TILs
  - Whether TILs predict pCR for the patients with HER2 positive breast cancer.
  - Large clinical trial dataset
  - cut-off 10%?


- lidERA
  - The first SERD for early ER+ breast cancer as monotherapy superior than AI
  - Control not CDK4i

- Phyllodes tumor
