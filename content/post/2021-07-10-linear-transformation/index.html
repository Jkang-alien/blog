<p>A <em>norm</em> of linear transformation <span class="math inline">\(\Lambda : X \rightarrow Y\)</span> is defined by <span class="math inline">\(\| \Lambda \| = \sup \{ \| \Lambda(x) \|:x \in X, \|x\| \le 1 \}\)</span>. We can give a <em>norm</em> to a space or a set. A <em>norm</em> determines the size of a vector in the function space. The way of measure the size of a vector gives important properties of the space like boundness, completeness or orthogonality. We can also select a set (<span class="math inline">\(L^{1}(\mu)\)</span>) to have a certain properties like boundness and completeness in a specific <em>norm</em> like <span class="math inline">\(\| * \|_2\)</span> and so on select <span class="math inline">\(C(X)\)</span> for
<span class="math inline">\(L^{\infty}\)</span>.</p>
<p>The linear transformation <span class="math inline">\(\Lambda\)</span> can compose a normed space <span class="math inline">\(\{\Lambda\}\)</span>. The space of linear transformation can have properties like boundness, completeness. The Banach-Steinhaus theorem states the limit of linear transformation between Banach spaces which a set of bounded linear transformation, <span class="math inline">\(\{\Lambda_{\alpha}\}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\alpha \in A\)</span> with Banach space in both domain and codomain has either bounded norm or unbounded supremum <span class="math inline">\(\| \Lambda_{\alpha} \|\)</span> for all some dense <span class="math inline">\(G_\delta\)</span> in domain. The limit of linear transformation space can be applied in convergence of differentiation and integration of simple function and Fourier transformation because those are series of linear transformation.</p>
