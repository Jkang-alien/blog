This HUGO academic theme blog is managed by blogdown. (https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/other-themes.html) The HUGO theme needs to transform `bib` file to each `reference.md` files. This can be done by `bib2academic` rpackage. (https://github.com/petzi53/bib2academic) For the featured publication, add `featured: true` in the `reference.md` file.
