<p>This HUGO academic theme blog is managed by blogdown. (<a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/other-themes.html" class="uri">https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/other-themes.html</a>) The HUGO theme needs to transform <code>bib</code> file to each <code>reference.md</code> files. This can be done by <code>bib2academic</code> rpackage. (<a href="https://github.com/petzi53/bib2academic" class="uri">https://github.com/petzi53/bib2academic</a>) For the featured publication, add <code>featured: true</code> in the <code>reference.md</code> file.</p>
