<p>This is a note for Rudin’s real and complex analysis chapter 1. The key concepts are <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span>-algebra, measure (<span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>) zero, and linear combination. The three concepts bring me abstract integration. The <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span>-algebra makes that countable sum and measure of complement (subtract measure) can be possible. Measure zero completes the system. linear combination integrates a measurable function.</p>
<p>After a measure space established, Lebesgue’s monotone convergence theorem, Fatou’s lemma, and Lebesgue’s dominant convergence theorem follow. Although three theorems do not contain <strong>integral</strong> in their name, they insist that pointwise convergent sequence of functions is also converging their integral of the limit of functions. Lebesgue’s monotone convergence theorem requires a monotonous increment of series of functions and Lebesgue’s dominant convergence theorem requires upper bound function. Fatou’s lemma is the inequality of the lower limit.</p>
<p>Lebesgue’s monotone convergence theorem can be proved by the fact all <span class="math inline">\(L_1(\mu)\)</span> has convergent simple function sequence. <span class="math inline">\(f_n\)</span> &gt; simple functions holds inequality of <span class="math inline">\(\lim\int f_n \geq \lim\int S_n = \int f\)</span>. Fatous’s lemma <span class="math inline">\(\lim \inf \int \lvert fn - f \rvert \leq\int \lim \inf \lvert f_n - f \rvert\)</span> is used for proof of Lebesgue’s dominant convergence.</p>
