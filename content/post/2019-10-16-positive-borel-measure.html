<p>This is a note of real and complex analysis chapter 2.</p>
<p>Chapter 2 is about measures. The measure already defined in chapter 1. In chapter 2, every linear <strong>functionals</strong>, not combination, of a continuous function space on compact set (<span class="math inline">\(C\)</span>) (<span class="math inline">\(\Lambda f\)</span>) represents the integration of the function (<span class="math inline">\(\int f du\)</span>) (Riesz representation theorem). Let X be a locally compact Hausdorf space, and let <span class="math inline">\(\Lambda\)</span> be a positive linear functional on <span class="math inline">\(C_c(X)\)</span>. Then there exist a <span class="math inline">\(\sigma-algebra\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> which contains all Borel sets in <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>, and there exists a unique positive measure <span class="math inline">\(mu\)</span> on <span class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{M}\)</span> which represents <span class="math inline">\(\Lambda\)</span> in the sense that (a) <span class="math inline">\(\Lambda f = \int f d \mu\)</span> for every <span class="math inline">\(f \in C_c(X)\)</span> and following additional properties:<br />
(b) <span class="math inline">\(\mu(K) &lt; \infty\)</span> for every compact set <span class="math inline">\(K \subset X\)</span>.<br />
(c) For every <span class="math inline">\(E \in \mathfrak{M}\)</span>, we have <span class="math display">\[ \mu(E) = inf\{\mu(V): E in V, V open\} \]</span>.<br />
(d) The relation <span class="math display">\[\mu(E)=sup\{\mu(K): K \in E, K compact\}\]</span><br />
holds for every open set <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span>, and for every <span class="math inline">\(E \in M\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(\mu(E) &lt; \infty\)</span>.<br />
(e) If <span class="math inline">\(E \in \mathfrak{M}, A subset E\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(\mu(E) = 0\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(A \in \mathfrak{M}\)</span>.</p>
<p>The Riesz theorem is about linear functional <span class="math inline">\(\Lambda\)</span> is equivalently replaced with choosing measure <span class="math inline">\(\mu(E)=sup\{\Lambda f: f \prec V\}\)</span>. Note <span class="math inline">\(sup \{\int^1_0 f(x)dx = \Lambda f: f \prec V, V (0,1) \} = 1\)</span>. The notion of <span class="math inline">\(\prec\)</span> include <span class="math inline">\(0 \le f \le 1\)</span>.</p>
<p>I confused <span class="math inline">\(C_c(X)\)</span></p>
