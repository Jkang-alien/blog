### Dr. Dina R. Mody

#### HPV test

* DNA HPV test will fail.
* BD (Oncolarity) is for a screening test.
* genotype 66 high risk.
* False-negative 10%. DNA copy number is the cause. 
* False positive cross reactivity 0.35%, 0.71% Aptima and Cobas. (one quarter) 

### Dr. Sneige

#### Immunostain in breast 

* Reduced and diminished myoepithelial cells, phenotypic alteration, SMA remain but others lost.
* Any positivity for MEC favors in situ than invasive.
* Metaplastic carcinoma and fibromatosis like 
* TTF-1 2% positive in breast cancer.

### Dr. Prieto

#### Cutaneous lymphoma

* Mycosis fungoides cell are atypical 7 fold folding nuclear membrane
* CD4 predominant than CD8

* CD8 mycosis fungoides
* Granulomatous MF
* Immunohistochemistry marker related to TX
  - CD25, CD30

### Again Dr. Mody

* Super D specimen preparation

### Dr. Moran
* Neuroendocrine carcinoma in lung
* Do not follow the WHO without own justification
