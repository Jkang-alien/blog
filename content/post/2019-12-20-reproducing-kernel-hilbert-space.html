<p>Finally arrive at reproducing kernel Hilbert space.
<a href="https://nzer0.github.io/reproducing-kernel-hilbert-space.html" class="uri">https://nzer0.github.io/reproducing-kernel-hilbert-space.html</a></p>
<p>The above post introduces RKHS in Korean. It was helpful. I had struggled to understand some concepts in RKHS. What does mean Hilbert space in terms of feature expansion? (<span class="math inline">\(f:\mathcal{X} \to \mathbb{R}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(f \in \mathcal{H}_K\)</span>) It was confusing the difference between <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span>. <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> means the function in Hilbert space and <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span> is <strong>evaluation</strong>.</p>
<p>I thought that the function can be represented by the inner product of the basis of feature space <span class="math inline">\(K(\cdot,x)\)</span> and coefficients <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>, and the coefficients are vectors in feature space.</p>
<p>The reproducing property of Kernel is <span class="math inline">\(\langle f, K(\cdot,x)\rangle_{\mathcal{H}} = f(x)\)</span>. Thus <span class="math inline">\(K(\cdot,x) \in \mathcal{H}_K\)</span>. <span class="math inline">\(K(\cdot,x)\)</span> is a <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> specified function in Hilbert space <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{H}_K\)</span> and an evaluator of the specific point x. This means the inner product of <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(K_{x}\)</span> is the value of <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> at point <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span>.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, kenel method is a <strong>different way of evaluating f in a specific point <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span></strong>. <strong>Evaluating a function</strong> <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> at a point <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is inner product of <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(L_x\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(L_x \in \mathcal{H}_K\)</span> is a <strong>evaluation functional</strong> which is a kernal function and linear <span class="math inline">\(K(\cdot, x)\)</span>. Reproducing property of <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{H}_K\)</span> can be achieved if all <span class="math inline">\(f \in \mathcal{H}\)</span> has bounded evaluation functionals (<span class="math inline">\(L_x\)</span>).</p>
<p>In least square methods, the parameters (<span class="math inline">\(\hat{\beta}\)</span>) are determined by inner product of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\beta} = (X^{T}X)^{-1}X^{T}y\)</span>. In Kernel method, <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\beta}\)</span> is determined <span class="math inline">\(\langle K(\cdot,x_i), K(\cdot,x_j), \rangle_{\mathcal{H}_K} = K(x_i, x_j)\)</span>. Each <span class="math inline">\(K(\cdot, x)\)</span> is a parameter and a argument (variable like <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>).</p>
<p>Some subclass of the loss function and penalty functions can be generated by a positive definite kernel. A Kernel accepts two arguments and a Kernel function does one argument and the other argument becomes parameter. Reproducing Kernel Hilbert space is a function space with Kernal function space with the evaluation functional as a Kernel. The feature expansion into the RKHS can use the Kernel matrix instead of the inner product of each variable <span class="math inline">\(X^TX\)</span>.</p>
<p>The important concepts are Hilbert space, inner product, Kernel function, evaluation functional, feature expansion, Fourier transformation, Reisz representation theorem (dual space <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{H}_{K}^*\)</span> of Hibert space <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{H}_K\)</span>)</p>
